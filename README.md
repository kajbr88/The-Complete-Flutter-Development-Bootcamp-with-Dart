# The Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart

This repository contains my personal project files and notes from "The Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart" course by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy.

## Course Description
This comprehensive course covers all the essential aspects of Flutter development, from the fundamentals of Dart programming to building complex, cross-platform mobile applications. It emphasizes practical, hands-on learning, enabling students to create beautiful and functional apps for both iOS and Android.

## Course Content
The course is structured into modules, covering topics such as:

* **Fundamental Flutter concepts:** e.g. Stateful vs. Stateless Widgets, Widget tree, state management, animations, themes and much more.
* **Fundamental Dart concepts:** e.g. lists, maps, enums, loops, futures, streams, mixins, classes, and much more.
* **Concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP):** The type system, variables, functions and methods, inheritance, classes and protocols.
* **Control Structures:** Using If/Else clauses, Switch statements and logic to control the flow of execution.
* **Data Structures:** How to work with collections, such as Lists and Maps.
* **Software Design:** How to organise and format code for readability and how to implement the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern.
* **Networking:** How to make asynchronous API calls, store and retrieve data from the cloud, and use the JSON format for server communication.
* **Data Storage:** How to use Firebase Cloud Firestore to act as a backend for your Flutter apps.
* **Authentication:** How to use log in and register users for your Flutter apps.
* **State Management:** How to use setState, prop drilling, lifting state up, callbacks and the Provider package to manage app state.
